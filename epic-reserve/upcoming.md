There are several features we know we want, some we think could be useful, and other things we're still looking into. Here is the list that will be ever growing.

* [ ] Imminent - Open pack page
* [ ] Imminent - Create NFT pack page
* [ ] Gather feedback from users regarding discoverability and what metadata should be present on an NFT pack.
* [ ] A [Solana Blink](https://solana.com/solutions/actions) to open NFT packs
* [ ] Affiliate program utilizing your X (Twitter) account and the Solana account associated to it via SNS, [link here](https://www.sns.id/twitter). Affiliates will receive a portion of the fee immediately anytime a user creates an NFT pack using their affiliate link or if that wallet is already associated to an affiliate link.
* [ ] Fully automate Kreechure holder payouts utilizing the Metaplex Hydra wallet.
* [ ] Custom NFT pack collections to empower creators to make their own packs that show up on their own creator page on marketplaces such as Magic Eden and Tensor.
* [ ] NFT packs that include hidden contents
* [ ] Mintable NFT packs: Similar to a normal mint but users will receive up to x number of NFTs on mint.
* [ ] **Research task**: Will the core metaplex primitives be sufficient, Core / Extensions / etc., or is a custom onchain program needed?
