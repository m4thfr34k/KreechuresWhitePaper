# Epic Reserve

### Overview

Unleash your creativity! Create unique NFT packs from your own collection.

Epic Reserve NFT packs give you the power to curate your own collector packs, any theme / include multiple collections, for collecting, trading, or selling.

You've been curating your collection for years. Now you can share that creativity with the world.

Create "welcome" packs, the tops hits, or even packs to give discounts when someone buys in bulk. NFT packs offer completely new ways to engage your community, complete your collection, and sale NFTs.

### How

NFT packs are normal [Metaplex Core](https://developers.metaplex.com/core) NFTs which means you can do whatever with them that you can do with any of your other NFTs. You'll see them in your Phantom wallet, you can list them on Magic Eden or Tensor, or send them to a friend.

The magic comes in the form of a [Creator Owned Escrow](https://developers.metaplex.com/token-metadata/escrow#creator-owned-escrow) account that is associated to that Core NFT. Which means you'll be able to load up that Core NFT pack with as many NFTs as you need to fit your theme, loading the escrow account, and once you close it those NFTs aren't accessible again until the NFT pack is opened.

We've got all of this down to a science. You simply choose what NFTs you want loaded and then our electronic elves create the NFT pack, sets the image as a gif of the included NFTs, and takes care of the metadata so everyone knows what's in the pack.
