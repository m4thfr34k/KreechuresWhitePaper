# Royalties

### What are NFT Royalties?

Royalties for NFTs on Solana results in creators, or whomever is set to receive the royalty, receiving a percentage of secondary sales, every time that NFT is sold in the future.

Let's take a second to think about this. If your account is set to receive royalties on an NFT, then **EVERY SINGLE TIME** it is sold in the future, you receive a percentage.

It can be owned by someone on the other side of the planet that you've never met.

It might sell while you're asleep at 3am.

It might sell once a week, a month, a year, or 10 times a day.

**EVERY** single time it sells, you get a %

### Implementation

An account owner snapshot will take place on 23 September 2022, at 5:00pm EDT. This will be the first snapshot of several.

All Kreechures, Deck 2, that are in your wallet, typically means 'unlisted', will have the Seller Fee Basis Points data updated so that your account receives 4% royalties on all future sells.

An additional attribute, Royalties Finalized, will be updated to 'Yes' and then the metadata will be set to immutable, which means it can never be changed again
