# ðŸŽ¨ Overview

Kreechures are crypto-collectibles and Alien NFTs that arrived on earth and need a home. They are non-fungible tokens (NFTs) stored on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) (SOL) blockchain.&#x20;

Kreechures are generative on-chain NFTs.

1st Mint: March 26th, 2021

The earliest Kreechures were born on a schedule, every 15ish mins. Because of this you'll see references to:

* Day 1 - those born on 26 March 2021
* March babies - those born the last few days of March 2021
* The 689 - those Kreechures born before the next project started

There are several different rarities in the collection that are discussed further on the rarities page.
