Kreechures operates [GenesysGo](https://twitter.com/GenesysGo) Shadow Operator Nodes.

Shadow Operators receive emissions of $SHDW every Solana epoch, approx. 10-times a month.

These emissions will be passed along to Kreechure NFT collectors via staking, in addition to the Kin they currently receive.

At this point in time, based on the price of 1 SHDW, it is not yet profitable to run a Shadow Operator Node. We currently run our nodes to contribute to the ecosystem knowing it's a monthly profit loss at this time.

As of 28 July 2022, SHDW rewards for staking Kreechures is pending.
