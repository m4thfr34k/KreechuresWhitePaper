# Royalties

### What are NFT Royalties?

Royalties for NFTs on Solana results in creators, or whomever is set to receive the royalty, receiving a percentage of secondary sales, every time that NFT is sold in the future.

Let's take a second to think about this. If your account is set to receive royalties on an NFT, then **EVERY SINGLE TIME** it is sold in the future, you receive a percentage.

It can be owned by someone on the other side of the planet that you've never met.

It might sell while you're asleep at 3am.

It might sell once a week, a month, a year, or 10 times a day.

**EVERY** single time it sells, you get a %

### Implementation

Account owner snapshots have been taken on three different occasions for the purpose of updating royalties.

All Kreechures, Deck 2, that were in collector's wallets had the Seller Fee Basis Points data updated so their account receives 4% royalties on all future sells.
